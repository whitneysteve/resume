Stephen Whitney's Resume
========================

This is the source code for my resume site. It's a React app created using [Facebook's create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Besides that, as with most things, it's a work in progress.

Working on this usually follows the following pattern. You'll need `yarn` and to run `./setup` to set up.

Create a branch
---------------

`./branch <branch_name>`

Usually I make some changes.

Run Locally
-----------

`./run`

This will start a development server and reload as appropriate.

Run Linter
----------

`./lint`

Commit, or Ship
---------------

If you want to commit and keep working run:

`./commit`

If you want to commit and are done, ship it!

`./ship`

The build folder is checked in for deployment on GitHub pages.

Other Commands
--------------

Run Tests
^^^^^^^^^

`./test`
