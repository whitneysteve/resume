This is the source code for my résumé site. It's a React app created using `Facebook's create-react-app <https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app>`_.

Besides that, as with msot things, it's a work in progress.

Working on this usually follows the following pattern. You'll need npm.

Create a branch
===============

`./branch <branch_name>`

Usually I make some changes.

Run Locally
===========

`./run`

This will start a development server and reload as appropriate.

Lint
====

`./lint`

Commit, or Ship
===============

If you want to commit and keep working run:

`./commit`

If you want to commit and are done, ship it!

`./ship`

Other Commands
==============

Test
----

`./test`
